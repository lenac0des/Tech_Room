// create a simple functional component for chat engine

****** CREATUNG PROPS *****
// within the chat engine component I am going to pass different props
// setting the height to 100vh is going to tell the application that we want our project to take up the whole page
// projectID is going to be a string that we are goint to get once the chat application is created
// userName is going to be the login of the user that wants to join the chat room
// userSecret is basically the users password
//  after creating all the props I went to chat engine dashboard to create the project

****** CHAT ENGINE ******
// Goto chatengine.io create an account and make a new project
// then the first step is to obtain your api key which is going to be you projectID then paste it into projectID
// after create your first user within chatengine and this will me the admin which is me
// next step is to create a chat name it whatever you want
// once the chat room is created on chat engine.io type in the admin username and password


****** CHAT FEED ******
// create a new prop for the chat feed called renderChatFeed.... by doing this you are creating your own component for the entire chat feed.
// then inside the parentesis put in chatAppProps for the chat feed
// then create a component called ChatFeed, then spread all the props that are comijng from the feed by adding the ... chatAppProps and wrap them in curly braces
// because chatfeed is a component you have to import it
